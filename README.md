# DigitalTwinKnuckleCrane
This repo is part of a PhD thesis that demonstrates the feasibility of physics-based digital twins for crane operations on ships. It does this by integrating physical modeling techniques: the finite element method (FEM) and 3D rigid Multibody Dynamics (MBD) using inter-process communication tools.
